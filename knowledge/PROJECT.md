# Aberrant Mobs

## What this is

A protocol for monsters on NeoForge 1.21.1, `com.chunkworks.aberrantmobs`, repo
`minecraft-aberrant-mobs`. A creature is a datapack profile plus a Blockbench project;
the protocol owns the rig, the body, the mind (a decision tree in JSON over senses, with
verbs in Java), the world verbs and the loot. The first creature is nfx's Face-Stealer,
a centipede eleven blocks long that lives deep underground, stalks, digs, grabs and eats.
The full design, agreed with Rusty on 2026-09-14, is the plan at
`~/.claude/plans/wiggly-cuddling-adleman.md`; it is being built in seven phases.

## Shape

Vanilla Wheels' layout: `domain` (JDK only, JUnit) <- `main` <- `gametest` (the tests
and the photo booth, a mod of their own). Written to the 6.031 bar: specs on every
operation, RI and AF on every ADT, immutable values, tests partitioned by the spec.

Phase 1 (done): `CreatureProfile` codec + the `aberrantmobs:creature` datapack registry;
one entity type `Aberrant`; `domain/BbRig` reads the project into a `Rig` of bones
(`Bone`, `Pose`, `Xform`, `Quat`); `client/RigLibrary` + `Skin` + `RigDrawer` +
`AberrantRenderer` draw it at rest. The model ships as received
(`assets/aberrantmobs/aberrantmobs/model/face_stealer.bbmodel`; a copy in
`tools/reference/`).

Phase 2 (done): the body -- `Trail`, `Undulation`, `ChainPose`, `LegGait`, `Body`
(pure, partitioned); the entity's trail and wave per side, the renderer laying the chain
from the interpolated head; `AberrantPart` per segment on the server, placed on the chain
each tick; `Carapace` and the synced crack, damage routed by segment, the glow drawn on
the cracked segment; `RigStore` reads the model from the jar for the server. Then the
feet: `Cells` (the one way the domain reads blocks; `LevelCells` in main), `Legs` (a
foot per leg planted on the level, stepped in the gait's metachronal order with at most
40 % swinging and a pair never together, swings shorter and strides longer with speed,
the surface found by a bisected cast on floor, wall or ceiling), `Body` deriving each
leg's segment, hip and rest foot from the file's pivots and cubes, the renderer aiming
each leg at its foot (`Legs.aim`, a lever: lift in the leg's plane then yaw). And the
clips: `Clip` (keys slerped, cues at ticks), `Animator` (one clip over the body's pose),
`FaceStealerClips` (coil, pounce, strike, grab, bite, flinch, death, with their cues);
the server starts a clip by name over synced data, both sides advance, the server acts
on cues (recorded for now; sounds and the dig's blocks hang on them later).

## How it is verified

`./gradlew test` (58 JUnit tests, the reader proved against the saved file),
`runGameTestServer` (6 gametests: the profile and the creature, the parts along the body
after a walk, only the crack takes a blow, most feet on the floor mid-walk, a clip's
cues on their ticks, a scripted walk), `runPhotoBooth` (15 checks: side, quarter, face,
a walking strip, from above, each clip playing on the client at its key frames, drawn
after the death). The booth world is normal difficulty with spawning off: a monster is
discarded in peaceful.

## Decisions

See `decisions/`.

## Next

Phase 3, crawl and dig: `Crawl`, `Burrow`, `Tunnel`, `Leap`; `DigWorld` removing blocks
on the strike clip's cue.
